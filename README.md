Modern solutions for control of prosthetic hands involve sensing intentional muscle contractions using myoelectric (EMG) muscle sensing. Unfortunately this is expensive - with modern electro-mechanical prostheses starting at around £ 10 000) - and sensitive to issues such as perspiration and sensor placement.

ATLAS is a novel prosthetic hand using mechanomyographic (MMG) muscle sensing to control the device. It is fully 3D printable and can be manufactured for under £ 300. The only requirements for reproducing this project are access to a 3D printer (such as the Creality Ender 3 that we used, £ 150) and a soldering station (roughly £ 10).

This project was completed as a university project by four members and there is plenty of scope for people to adapt and improve our work. The project is documented on this page, however, names and identifying information about the group members have been redacted in some places for privacy.
